I'm Peter, a systems and infrastructure software engineer. I'm currently living
in Berlin, Germany, working on search and discovery for
[SoundCloud](http://soundcloud.com).

I'm into well-designed and maintainable code, avoiding pre- and
over-optimization, and best practices.
For fun, I do a lot of reading, and when the weather's nice, I'm an avid
runner. Some good things to read on the internet are, in no particular order,
 [the Atlantic](http://www.theatlantic.com),
 [Salon](http://www.salon.com),
 [the Times](http://www.nytimes.com),
 [the New Yorker](http://www.newyorker.com),
 [Gothamist](http://gothamist.com),
 [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com),
 and [Bike Snob](http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com).
Some nice things to read on read trees are, in particular order,
 [Joseph Conrad](http://www.gutenberg.org/browse/authors/c#a125),
 [Fyodor Dostoyevsky](http://www.gutenberg.org/browse/authors/d#a314),
 [David Wallace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Foster_Wallace),
 and [Neal Stephenson](http://www.nealstephenson.com).
