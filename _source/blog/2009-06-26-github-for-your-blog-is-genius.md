title: Github for your blog? Genius!
---

Apparently
[someone](http://github.com/raganwald/homoiconic)
is using
[github](http://github.com)
(one of many free, online version control systems) as a platform for their
little programming blog or whatever. Freaking *genius!* VCS is the immediate
solution to so many classes of data- related problems that I'm not sure why I
didn't think of this idea sooner. A simple, portable VCS-to-HTML translation
layer running on your webhost of choice, and suddenly you have a really amazing,
open, transparent and extremely performant data-driven website. This is a really
good idea; I should code that up.
