> You get up in the morning, go to your challenging, white-collar,
> college-graduate job, and you work hard for eight or ten hours, and at the
> end of the day you're tired and somewhat stressed and all you want is to go
> home and have a good supper and maybe unwind for an hour, and then hit the
> sack early because, of course, you have to get up the next day and do it all
> again.  But then you remember there's no food at home. You haven't had time
> to shop this week because of your challenging job, and so now after work you
> have to get in your car and drive to the supermarket. It's the end of the
> work day and the traffic is apt to be: very bad. So getting to the store
> takes way longer than it should, and when you finally get there, the
> supermarket is very crowded, because of course it's the time of day when all
> the other people with jobs also try to squeeze in some grocery shopping. And
> the store is hideously lit and infused with soul-killing muzak or corporate
> pop and it's pretty much the last place you want to be but you can't just get
> in and quickly out; you have to wander all over the huge, over-lit store's
> confusing aisles to find the stuff you want and you have to manoeuvre your
> junky cart through all these other tired, hurried people with carts, et
> cetera et cetera, and eventually you get all your supper supplies, except now
> it turns out there aren't enough check-out lanes open even though it's the
> end-of-the-day rush. So the checkout line is incredibly long, which is stupid
> and infuriating. But you can't take your frustration out on the frantic lady
> working the register, who is overworked at a job whose daily tedium and
> meaninglessness surpasses the imagination of any of us.
> 
> You finally get to the checkout line's front, and you pay for your food, and
> you get told to "Have a nice day" in a voice that is the absolute voice of
> death. Then you have to take your creepy, flimsy, plastic bags of groceries
> in your cart with the one crazy wheel that pulls maddeningly to the left, all
> the way out through the crowded, bumpy, littery parking lot, and then you
> have to drive all the way home through slow, heavy, SUV-intensive, rush-hour
> traffic, et cetera et cetera.
> 
> The point is that petty, frustrating crap like this is exactly where the work
> of choosing is gonna come in. Because **the traffic jams and crowded aisles
> and long checkout lines give me time to think, and if I don't make a
> conscious decision about how to think and what to pay attention to, I'm gonna
> be pissed and miserable every time I have to shop**. Because my natural
> default setting is the certainty that situations like this are really all
> about me. About MY hungriness and MY fatigue and MY desire to just get home,
> and it's going to seem for all the world like everybody else is just in my
> way. And who are all these people in my way? And look at how repulsive most
> of them are, and how stupid and cow-like and dead-eyed and nonhuman they seem
> in the checkout line, or at how annoying and rude it is that people are
> talking loudly on cell phones in the middle of the line. And look at how
> deeply and personally unfair this is.
> 
> 0r, of course, if I'm in a more socially conscious liberal arts form of my
> default setting, I can spend time in the end-of-the-day traffic being
> disgusted about all the huge, stupid, lane-blocking SUV's and Hummers and
> V-12 pickup trucks, burning their wasteful, selfish, 40-gallon tanks of gas,
> and I can dwell on the fact that the patriotic or religious bumper-stickers
> always seem to be on the biggest, most disgustingly selfish vehicles, driven
> by the ugliest, most inconsiderate and aggressive drivers. And I can think
> about how our children's children will despise us for wasting all the
> future's fuel, and probably screwing up the climate, and how spoiled and
> stupid and selfish and disgusting we all are, and how modern consumer society
> just sucks, and so forth and so on.
> 
> If I choose to think this way in a store and on the freeway, fine. Lots of us
> do. Except thinking this way tends to be so easy and automatic that it
> doesn't have to be a choice. It is my natural default setting. It's the
> automatic way that I experience the boring, frustrating, crowded parts of
> adult life when I'm operating on the automatic, unconscious belief that I am
> the centre of the world, and that my immediate needs and feelings are what
> should determine the world's priorities.
> 
> The thing is that, of course, **there are totally different ways to think
> about these kinds of situations**. In this traffic, all these vehicles
> stopped and idling in my way, it's not impossible that some of these people
> in SUV's have been in horrible auto accidents in the past, and now find
> driving so terrifying that their therapist has all but ordered them to get a
> huge, heavy SUV so they can feel safe enough to drive. Or that the Hummer
> that just cut me off is maybe being driven by a father whose little child is
> hurt or sick in the seat next to him, and he's trying to get this kid to the
> hospital, and he's in a bigger, more legitimate hurry than I am: it is
> actually I who am in HIS way.
> 
> Or I can choose to force myself to consider the likelihood that everyone else
> in the supermarket's checkout line is just as bored and frustrated as I am,
> and that some of these people probably have harder, more tedious and painful
> lives than I do.
> 
> Please don't think that I'm giving you moral advice, or that I'm saying you
> are supposed to think this way, or that anyone expects you to just
> automatically do it. Because it's hard. It takes will and effort, and if you
> are like me, some days you won't be able to do it, or you just flat out won't
> want to.
> 
> But most days, if you're aware enough to give yourself a choice, you can
> choose to look differently at this fat, dead-eyed, over-made-up lady who just
> screamed at her kid in the checkout line. Maybe she's not usually like this.
> Maybe she's been up three straight nights holding the hand of a husband who
> is dying of bone cancer. Or maybe this very lady is the low-wage clerk at the
> motor vehicle department, who just yesterday helped your spouse resolve a
> horrific, infuriating, red-tape problem through some small act of
> bureaucratic kindness.  Of course, none of this is likely, but it's also not
> impossible. It just depends what you want to consider. If you're
> automatically sure that you know what reality is, and you are operating on
> your default setting, then you, like me, probably won't consider
> possibilities that aren't annoying and miserable.  But if you really learn
> how to pay attention, then you will know there are other options. It will
> actually be within your power to experience a crowded, hot, slow,
> consumer-hell type situation as not only meaningful, but sacred, on fire with
> the same force that made the stars: love, fellowship, the mystical oneness of
> all things deep down.
> 
> Not that that mystical stuff is necessarily true. **The only thing that's
> capital-T True is that you get to decide how you're gonna try to see it**.
> 
> *This, I submit, is the freedom of a real education, of learning how to be
> well-adjusted. You get to consciously decide what has meaning and what
> doesn't*.
