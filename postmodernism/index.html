<h1>Postmodernism</h1>
<h2>WTF?</h2>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Caveat #1</h1>
<img src="img/i-have-no-idea-what-im-doing-dog.jpg" />
<p>I've got no real education in this stuff.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Caveat #2</h1>
<img src="img/thats-just-like-your-opinion-man.jpg" />
<p>Almost everything I'm going to say is just, like, my opinion, man, and can
probably be trivially countered by example.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Why?</h1>
<h2>What's the motivation?</h2>
<p>So if I don't know anything, and everything I say is just opinion, why am I
presenting this stuff? Well, I think there <strong>is</strong> a coherent
narrative to be told, and I think having <strong>some</strong> context when you
go to an art place and experience some art can make the difference between being
bored out of your mind and maybe enjoying things a little bit. It certainly had
that effect for me.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Wikipedia</h1>
<img src="img/wikipedia-screenshot.png" />
<p>So I guess we're done here. (Just kidding.)</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<img src="img/wikipedia-zoom.png" />
<p>I want to focus on these ones in purple, because I've clicked on them and
read them. And also because art is relatively easy, and I like architecture
pretty good.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1><span style="color:#ddd;">Post</span>modernism</h1>
<p>To talk about Postmodernism, I guess you have to look at Modernism first.
But as it turns out that's actually not enough, because Modernism was already
kind of a response to stuff that came before it. So let's wrap all that up into
one little box and call it...</p>
</div>


<div class="title slide premodern">
<h1>"Pre-modern"</h1>
<h2>&mdash;1915</h2>
<h3>Representational</h3>
<p>"Pre-modern" isn't actually A Thing, it's just convenient for our
purposes. Classical, Romanticism. The Netherlands, France, etc. You can
say a lot about pre-modern, but the important thing in this narrative is that
it was representational.</p>
</div>

</div>

<div class="slide premodern title">
<h1>Architecture</h1>
<p>Architecture is trickier. A building is always first and foremost a building,
so "representation" is harder to define. I think it's best to look at some
second-order characteristics. And I think it's helpful to consider the typology
of the building. That is, there were historical rules that were generally
followed to make a Church a Church, or a Palace a Palace. And we can kind of
categorize buildings according to how typological they are.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide premodern">
<h1>Wren</h1>
<h2>St. Paul's Cathedral</h2>
<h3>Neogothic</h3>
<img src="img/wren-st-pauls-cathedral-exterior.jpg" />
<p>For example, St. Paul's Cathedral is super Churchy. It's not mistakable for
anything else. It <strong>represents</strong> a Church. It takes all these older
Church idioms and decoration, and updates them (for its time) into this really
definitive style, called Neogothic.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide premodern">
<h1>Boullée</h1>
<h2>Newton's Cenotaph</h2>
<h3>Neoclassical</h3>
<img src="img/boulee-newtons-cenotaph.jpg" />
<p>Boullée was super weird and ahead of his time. But you can still think of his
work as representational: Newton's Monument was directly informed by Newton's
mathematics.</p>

<div class="title slide modern">
<h1>Modern</h1>
<h2>1915&mdash;1945</h2>
<h3>Non-representational</h3>
<p>Also known as abstract. Basically, modern artists decided they were sick of
always representing stuff literally, and started approaching things, ideas,
forms, even art itself abstractly.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide modern">
<h1>Brancusi</h1>
<h2>Bird In Space</h2>
<h3>(Pure) Abstract</h3>
<img src="img/brancusi-bird-in-space.jpg" />
<p>So, this is clearly not a bird. Is it the artist's idea of a bird? Some
proto-bird? The flight path of a bird?</p>
</div>

<div class="slide modern">
<h1>Dali</h1>
<h2>The Persistence of Memory</h2>
<h3>Surrealism</h3>
<img src="img/dali-persistence-of-memory.jpg" />
</div>

<div class="slide modern">
<h1>Picasso</h1>
<h2>Guernica</h2>
<h3>Surrealism; Cubism</h3>
<img src="img/picasso-guernica.jpg" />
</div>

<div class="slide modern">
<h1>Picasso</h1>
<h2>The Old Guitarist</h2>
<img src="img/picasso-old-guitarist.jpg" />
<p>Just an aside: Picasso wasn't exclusively weird stuff.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide modern">
<h1>Duchamp</h1>
<h2>Fountain</h2>
<h3>Dadaism (arguably Postmodern)</h3>
<img src="img/duchamp-fountain.jpg" />
</div>

<div class="slide modern">
<h1>Mondrian</h1>
<h2>Composition C No. III in Red, Yellow and Blue</h2>
<h3>De Stijl</h3>
<img src="img/mondrian-composition-c.jpg" />
</div>

<div class="slide modern">
<h1>van Doesburg</h1>
<h2>Contra-Composition XVI in dissonances</h2>
<h3>De Stilj</h3>
<img src="img/van-doesburg-contra-composition.jpg" />
<p>Theo van Doesburg was hugely influenced by Piet Mondrian, and they were
initially friends and peers, but they eventually had a falling-out: Mondrian
couldn't accept diagonals (Neo-Plasticism) and van Doesburg loved 'em
(Elementarism). Literally a friendship ruined by 45&deg;.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide modern">
<h1>Corbusier</h1>
<h2>Villa Savoye</h2>
<img src="img/corbusier-villa-savoye.jpg" />
<p>Early Corbusier is basically seminal modern architecture, which was about
rejecting decoration and classical forms, and building structurally, or
tectonically. Think: lines and surfaces, bare/pure materials. "Form follows
function" as opposed to "Function imposed by form." It's hard to live in an
abstract house, but modern architecture was like modern art in that they both
stripped away ornamentation.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide modern">
<h1>Wright</h1>
<h2>Fallingwater</h2>
<p>The modernist ethos is kind of that people are functional entities that need
things: light, air, space. Buildings are therefore machines for living. Drawing
on the commercial/industrial age, buildings became somehow sleek, machine; a
kind of functional cleanliness that demanded everything be in its right place.
Not only in the building itself: residential, commercial, industrial must all
be separate.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide modern">
<h1>Wright</h1>
<h2>Guggenheim Museum</h2>
</div>

<div class="slide modern">
<h1>Corbusier</h1>
<h2>Domino House</h2>
<p>This is more of a general idea than a specific building.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide modern">
<h1>Mies</h1>
<h2>Seagram Building</h2>
</div>

<div class="slide modern">
<h1>Mies</h1>
<h2>Neue Nationale Gallerie</h2>
</div>

<div class="title slide postmodern">
<h1>Postmodern</h1>
<h2>1945&mdash;1980?</h2>
<p>Exactly when it ended depends on the medium and the artist, but it's over
now.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide postmodern">
<h1>Lichtenstein</h1>
<h2>Wham!</h2>
<p>Postmodern is actually an umbrella term to cover several distinct movements
that happened at the same time. In painting, postmodernism reintroduces
representation. Sometimes, very direct representation.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide postmodern">
<h1>Warhol</h1>
<h2>Campbell's</h2>
</div>

<div class="slide postmodern">
<h1>Campbell's</h1>
<h2>Letter to Andy Warhol</h2>
<p>This is just an aside, but I found it pretty funny. Could this happen today?
I'm pretty sure it would be printed on a lawyer's letterhead.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide postmodern">
<h1>Christo + Jeanne-Claude</h1>
<h2>Surrounded Islands</h2>
<p>TODO something about broader scopes and land-art.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide postmodern">
<h1>Smithson</h1>
<h2>Spiral Jetty</h2>
</div>

<div class="slide postmodern">
<h1>Koons</h1>
<h2>Balloon Dog</h2>
</div>

<div class="slide postmodern">
<h1>Hirst</h1>
<h2>For The Love Of God</h2>
</div>

<div class="slide postmodern">
<h1>Venturi</h1>
<h2>The Decorated Shed</h2>
<p>Postmodern architecture rejected the minimalism of modern architecture as
totally boring. It's often about a narrative conception. That is, think of
a building not as walls + floors + roof, but as something else altogether.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide postmodern">
<h1>Venturi</h1>
<h2>The Duck</h2>
<p>No, really. This stuff is a joke. In the best way.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide postmodern">
<h1>Loos</h1>
<h2>Chicago Tribune Tower competition</h2>
</div>

<div class="slide postmodern">
<h1>I.M. Pei</h1>
<h2>Landau Building</h2>
<p>Probably most famous for the entrance pyramid to the Louvre.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide postmodern">
<h1>Gehry</h1>
<h2>Guggenheim Bilbao</h2>
</div>

<div class="slide postmodern">
<h1>Gehry</h1>
<h2>Gehry House</h2>
<p>Postmodern architecture also reacted negatively toward the idea of modernist
functional separation. Homes distinct from shops&mdash;suburbs!&mdash;what a
terrible idea!</p>
</div>

<div class="slide postmodern">
<h1>Rossi</h1>
<h2>Bonnefantan Museum</h2>
</div>

<div class="slide postmodern">
<h1>Rossi</h1>
<h2>Alessi Steel Kettle</h2>
<p>Looks a little modern, doesn't it?</p>
</div>

<div class="slide postmodern">
<h1>Rogers + Piano</h1>
<h2>Pompidou Center</h2>
<p>Arguably postmodern, due to its emphasis on form following function.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide postmodern">
<h1>Corbusier</h1>
<h2>Notre Dame du Haut (Ronchamp)</h2>
