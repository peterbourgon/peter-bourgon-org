{ "title": "Strong feelings" }
---

I don’t have a lot of feelings about things, these days. I don’t know if it’s a
defense mechanism or a real change of belief. It could be that, as I age, the
weight of an infinite reality settles on my opinions like a great ambivalence,
countering any thought with its equal-and-opposite.

One explanation might be that I’m learning a lot. Which is great; maybe life as
a learner is life without strong sentiment.

Yet I’m surprised how it’s leaked into so many areas of my character. It’s easy
to appreciate the image of a skeptical/accepting Buddha, but (as it turns out)
there are situations in life where a lack of strong feelings is an unambiguous
negative.
