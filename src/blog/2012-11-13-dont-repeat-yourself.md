[Don't repeat yourself][1]. But, all things in moderation; [counterpoint][2]:

> Sometimes repeating code is simpler and easier to understand than trying to
> force an abstraction just to avoid duplication. I think code readability and
> ease of understanding trumps other concerns. I would rather have a function I
> can read top to bottom and understand what is happening than to avoid
> duplication just for the sake of DRY. I think Go hits the sweet spot in this
> regard. I've had nightmares debugging in dynamic languages where DRY is taken
> to the extreme and you are lost in a maze of indirection because the library
> authors wanted to avoid repeating a couple lines of code here and there.
