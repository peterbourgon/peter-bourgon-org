For a variety of reasons, I'm moving to
[Johannesburg](http://www.joburg.org.za/)
next month for about a year. There's not much industry there, so I'm going to be
plugging away at a few personal projects I've thought up over the past few
years. Probably barbecue some things. The usual. There's a
[travel log](http://plback.tumblr.com)
that'll get updated at some point. I've known for awhile, but I felt it prudent
to exercise caution re: my job situation at the time. The consequences of being
a part of a large corporation and all.

oh god *oh god*, this is the sound of my bank account slowly draining into
Japan.

I'm pretty isolated from "Real America," so the health care debate is something
that, for me, exists only in the abstract. It shouldn't be, really; since I'm no
longer among the majority of Americans who get health care via my employer I
guess it would behoove me to follow the arguments. But that brings me right to
my point: there *isn't* an argument going on, there is
[one guy](http://www.whitehouse.gov)
with an idea on how to address some problems, and then there are about a hundred
thousand
[raging idiots](http://egan.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/09/palins-poison)
screaming at the top of their lungs. I mean, we are literally to the point where
people are taking virulent, righteous stands against *completely fictional*,
*fabricated* positions. The textbook definition of the strawman logical fallacy.
When that kind of unchecked ignorance is at work in the marketplace it actually
ends up saving me a lot of effort. I don't have to really analyze everything on
offer. I know instinctually that whatever people so gloriously ignorant oppose
is almost by definition the right answer. Accordingly: bring on single-payer
health care, you have my vote, *etc*.
