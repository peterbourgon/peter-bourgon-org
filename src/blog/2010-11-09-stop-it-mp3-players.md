{ "title": "Stop it: MP3 players" }
---
Is daily life so interminably insufferable that being forced to engage the
world without a personal soundtrack is somehow on the same level as leaving the
house without your wallet or keys? It's nonsense. Despite the persistent
affirmations of the affluent consumer society around you, an MP3 player is
manifestly *not* a daily accessory.

Even more than simply being an extra half-pound slab of money and metal in your
pocket, your MP3 player makes this really awful statement about your relation
to your environment, by which I mean your society, by which I mean the rest of
humanity. By plugging in your ear-buds you're effectively turning off one of
your senses, which as a statement reads either as being too good for the place
you're in, or too bored. or in any case that you want to separate yourself from
your surroundings to the maximum allowable degree. I have those moods too, but
when I feel like indulging them I *stay at home*.
