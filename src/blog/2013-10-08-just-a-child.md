{"title": "\"Just a child\""}
---

Recently, a respected colleague referred to himself as "just a child". He meant
it negatively, but I thought about it positively. The idea of childhood is to me
this pure thing, pure not in an innocent way but in the sense that the joy of
life and experience are unsquelched. I look to childhood and admire and lament.
I compare the best among us to children; I say their best qualities are
childlike qualities, not dampened by the monotony of daily existence but
effusive, naïve in the good-sense of naïve, full not of exception but potential.

I believe these things because the perspective of a life lived seems to beat
into me the cadence of impossibility. I fall into the trench of defining
myself in terms of boundaries: I am the sort of fellow who so-and-so; it's
not appropriate that I should _et cetera_.

I sit in the castle made of my life-experience and perceive the boundaries of my
life-kingdom. Those boundaries are the product of an intersection: my self, my
intuitions and natural tendencies, and the observed effect of those tendencies
applied to the material world. I perceive from this my point of reference, and
struggle to break free.

The march of life and life's experience channels me into trenches of
perspective, coloring everything I see in dark brown, burning in patterns to my
behavior, tendencies to my character, history to my story, rendering it one way
or the other, inevitably stripping it of the purity and innocence that I can
imagine once having had. It's in fact _work_ to retain my childlike qualities of
wonder and awe and good-type naïvety and humor and no foregone opinions or
conclusions. My colleague is lucky.
