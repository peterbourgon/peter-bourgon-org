{ "title": "Ethical responsibility" }
---

Even if the same _form_ of a rule (ban X from Y) can be used both for good (ban
Nazis from Twitter) and for bad (ban women from public places) we aren't obliged
to throw the rule in all of its forms away. We can apply the rule in ways that
reduce suffering, and refuse to apply it in ways that increase suffering. 

Not only _can_ we do that, but we're ethically _obliged_ to do it, because it's
the ethical responsibility of humans to reduce suffering. Not conceptually, not
theoretically, but actually, in effect and consequence, on the lives of our
fellow humans. We're not slaves to an arbitrary and inhumane objectivity.
Systems of all types&mdash;software, legal, civil&mdash;have humanity as a
foundation, not the other way around.
