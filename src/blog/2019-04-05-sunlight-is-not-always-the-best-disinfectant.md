{"title":"Sunlight is not always the best disinfectant"}
---
Defenses of free speech, up to and including free speech absolutism, are
sometimes centered on axioms like "sunlight is the best disinfectant". The
theory goes that it's better to expose bad ideas to society, so that society can
kill them outright, rather than hiding them away, and letting them fester and
grow in darkness.

But this presupposes an open system, where sunlight is always capable of
overpowering infection. Or, said another way, it discounts the externalities of
exposed contagions. It's one thing to imagine there's a moldy plate in the
middle of your sunny backyard, but another thing entirely to imagine a
completely polluted ecosystem. Those ruined landscapes require more than
sunlight. You can't just treat the result, you have to stop the causes.

There are classes of speech that are, to abuse the metaphor, a lot more like
ruined landscapes than moldy plates. The rise of ethno-nationalism and race
supremacy in western democracies is certainly among them. Relying on the
disinfecting power of exposure is na√Øve to the point of being immoral. Society
doesn't disinfect the disease, the disease infects society. 

We know now that blind application of free speech as a doctrine merely
cedes the public square to the extremists, and results in a shittier society. 
Those with the power to do so have both the right and ethical obligation to
stop these infections at the source, by organizing, by protesting, by
de-platforming, and by recognizing that free speech isn't an end in itself, but
merely a means, a tool, which we're obliged to use to make our society better.
