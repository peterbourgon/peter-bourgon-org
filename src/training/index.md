I've been programming Go since its release in 2009, and I've been doing it full-time and professionally since 2011.
I've written line of business applications, infrastructure glue code, distributed data systems, deployment and orchestration platforms, and toolkits for microservices.
And, over the years, I've given many talks and workshops on the language, its internals, best practices, and program design, to a wide variety of audiences.

If your organization wants to level up your Go knowledge, I can probably help.
I do half- and full-day courses on pretty much any Go or microservice topic you can imagine.
I also do a 3 to 4 day intensive course, teaching Go from first principles to groups of any skill level.

My training style is thorough, didactic, and interactive.
I highlight best practices, idioms, and antipatterns: stuff you can't necessarily get from books and literature.
