<p>
I'm a distributed systems and infrastructure engineer with more than 13 years of
experience building large, fast, and reliable software. I'm an expert Go
programmer, with multiple large-scale projects to my credit, strong ties to the
community, and a commitment to education and mentoring.
</p>

<p>
Outside of my professional work, I like to stay active in the open-source community.
My current projects include <a href="https://gokit.io">Go kit</a>, a sort of standard library for microservices in Go;
 and <a href="https://github.com/oklog/oklog">OK Log</a>, a distributed log management system.
</p>

<p>
My areas of interest include
 CRDTs and coördination-free systems;
 observability;
 microservices and dev/ops tools; and
 Go best practices, including internal and external training courses.
Some selected talks and articles include:
 a detailed piece about <a href="/ok-log">OK Log</a>, focusing on motivation, design, and optimization;
 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ha8gdZ27wMo">Evolutionary Optimization</a>, a Go-focused talk on the same subject, at GopherCon;
 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX0sHF8ZZgw">Applied Go kit</a> at KubeCon Europe; and
 an article disambiguating <a href="/blog/2017/02/21/metrics-tracing-and-logging.html">metrics, tracing, and logging</a>.

On the Data team, I maintained and hardened the infrastructure that powers
billing, real-time and historical stats, and customer logging.

</p>
<p>

On the Production Engineering team, I led a migration of the company from a 
heterogeneous mix of monitoring tools to <a href="https://prometheus.io">Prometheus</a>.
Most of my work was focused on developer outreach, embedding in teams to teach
best practices around service instrumentation, dashboards, and alerts.

<td class="what" colspan=2>
<p>

Weaveworks acquired my infrastructure mapping and monitoring side project, which became
 <a href="https://github.com/weaveworks/scope">Weave Scope</a>.
At Weaveworks I continued to develop Scope,
 bootstrapped <a href="https://cloud.weave.works">Weave Cloud</a> on AWS with Kubernetes,
 worked on the gossip and CRDT library <a href="https://github.com/weaveworks/mesh">Weave Mesh</a>,
 and developed the change management tool <a href="https://github.com/weaveworks/flux">Weave Flux</a>.

On the Discovery team, I was the lead architect and engineer for search.
I migrated us from Solr to Elasticsearch, rebuilt the indexing and query pipelines,
 and integrated machine learning models for ranking and relevance.
I focused on latency KPIs, operational (dev/ops) simplicity, and scalability.
That infrastructure continues to power the search product today.

</p>
<p>

On the Activities team, I rebuilt the infrastructure that powers most of SoundCloud's event feeds.
At the core is <a href="https://github.com/soundcloud/roshi">Roshi</a>, an open-source, CRDT-based distributed system for events.
Several major product features, including the SoundCloud stream, were powered by Roshi.

</p>
<p>

On the Infrastructure team, I developed a next-generation containerized application platform based on
 <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~rxin/db-papers/WarehouseScaleComputing.pdf">The Datacenter as a Computer</a>.
I was the technical lead for the complete ecosystem:
 a container supervisor, a cluster scheduler, a service discovery system based on Consul,
 and the necessary glue components for them to interact.
(Full disclosure: the project was canceled.)

<td class="what" colspan=2>
<p>

IPTEGO was a small company that made a network monitoring product called PALLADION.
I contributed several protocol analyzers, including RTCP, MEGACO, DIAMETER, and RTP.
In time, I moved to the core technology group, and built several distributed systems
 that scaled the product to continent-sized installations at major telecoms.
Eventually, I became a product manager for that group,
 and (among other things) was responsible for build and release management.

</p>
<p>

I left when IPTEGO was acquired by Acme Packet.
Around a year later, Acme Packet was acquired by Oracle.

Bloomberg is an information services company, focusing on financial data.
I was an engineer on the BLAW team, which provided research tools for corporate lawyers.
I focused on BBLS, a federated (distributed) legal document search engine.
I scaled BBLS from dozens to thousands of concurrent users,
 and from tens- to hundreds-of-millions of documents.
My job involved defining and maintaining strict SLAs, system health monitoring,
 and code quality control measures.

ADTRAN manufactures network equipment for carriers and the enterprise.
I was a co-op student engineer (like a recurring internship) on several different teams.
I implemented SNMP and TFTP features on embedded-class hardware,
 and developed multiple new features for ADTRAN's routers and switches,
 with an emphasis on security and VPN technologies.
