I initially joined SoundCloud's Discovery team, and was the lead architect and
engineer for search. I migrated from Solr to Elasticsearch, rebuilt the
indexing and query pipelines, and integrated machine learning models for
ranking and relevance. Heavy emphasis was placed on correctness, operational
(dev-ops) simplicity, and scalability. The resulting infrastructure continues
to power the search product today.

</p>
<p>

I moved to the Activities team, and rebuilt the data system that powers
several time-series event streams. The core of that system is
<a href="https://github.com/soundcloud/roshi">Roshi</a>,
an open-source, CRDT-based distributed system for timestamped events. The
SoundCloud stream, and several other major product features, are powered by
Roshi.

</p>
<p>

Currently, I'm on the Infrastructure team, working on our next-generation
application platform.

<td class="what" colspan=2>
<p>

IPTEGO was a small company that provided a flagship network and telephony
monitoring product called PALLADION. I initially contributed several protocol
parsers and analyzers for PALLADION, including RTCP, MEGACO, DIAMETER, and
RTP. In time I moved to the core technology team, and helped scale the product
to handle much larger (continent-sized) installations. Eventually, I became a
product manager for that team, and (among other things) became responsible for
build and release management.

</p>
<p>

When I left, IPTEGO was acquired by Acme Packet. Around a year later, Acme
Packet was acquired by Oracle.

I spent a year in Johannesburg, South Africa, volunteering for several NGOs,

<p>

Bloomberg is an information services company, primarily focusing on financial
data. I joined Bloomberg's BLAW team, which provided a search engine and
research tools for corporate lawyers. I was primarily responsible for BBLS, a
federated, proprietary legal document search engine. In my time there, I
developed the infrastructure to allow it to grow from dozens to thousands of
concurrent users, and from tens to hundreds of millions of documents. That
involved defining and maintaining strict SLAs, system health monitoring, and
code quality control measures.

<td class="what" colspan=2>
<p>

ADTRAN manufactures network equipment for carriers and the enterprise. I was a
co-op student engineer (similar to an ongoing internship) in several different
departments. I implemented SNMP and TFTP features on embedded-class hardware,
and developed multiple new features for ADTRAN's enterprise routers and
switches, with an emphasis on security and VPN technologies.
