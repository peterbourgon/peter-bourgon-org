On the Discovery team, I was the lead architect and engineer for search. I
migrated us from Solr to Elasticsearch, rebuilt the indexing and query
pipelines, and integrated machine learning models for ranking and relevance. I
placed heavy emphasis on latency, operational (dev-ops) simplicity, and
scalability. That infrastructure continues to power the search product today.

</p>
<p>

On the Activities team, I rebuilt the infrastructure that powers many of our
time-series event feeds. At the core of that infrastructure is
<a href="https://github.com/soundcloud/roshi">Roshi</a>,
an open-source, CRDT-based distributed system for timestamped events. Several
major features, including the SoundCloud stream, are powered by Roshi.

</p>
<p>

Currently, I'm on the Infrastructure team, working on our next-gen application
platform.

<td class="what" colspan=2>
<p>

IPTEGO was a small company that provided a flagship network monitoring product
called PALLADION. I contributed several protocol parsers and analyzers,
including RTCP, MEGACO, DIAMETER, and RTP. In time, I moved to the core
technology group, and built several distributed systems that scaled the
product to much larger (continent-sized) installations at major telecom
companies. Eventually, I became a product manager for that group, and (among
other things) was responsible for build and release management.

</p>
<p>

When I left, IPTEGO was acquired by Acme Packet. Around a year later, Acme
Packet was acquired by Oracle.

Bloomberg is an information services company, primarily focusing on financial
data. I was an engineer on the BLAW team, which provided research tools for
corporate lawyers. I focused on BBLS, a federated (distributed) legal document
search engine. In my time there, I scaled BBLS from dozens to thousands of
concurrent users, and from tens- to hundreds-of-millions of documents. My job
involved defining and maintaining strict SLAs, system health monitoring, and
code quality control measures.

<p>

ADTRAN manufactures network equipment for carriers and the enterprise. I was a
co-op student engineer (similar to an ongoing internship) in several different
departments. I implemented SNMP and TFTP features on embedded-class hardware,
and developed multiple new features for ADTRAN's routers and switches, with an
emphasis on security and VPN technologies.

I earned a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in Computer Engineering, which is a mix
of pure Computer Science and Electrical Engineering. I emphasized software
engineering and network (distributed) programming.
