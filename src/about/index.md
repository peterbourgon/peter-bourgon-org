I'm Peter, a software engineer focusing on large-scale distributed systems.
I'm currently living in Berlin, Germany, working on the infrastructure that
powers [SoundCloud](http://soundcloud.com).

I prefer to write software that solves a specific, tightly-defined problem,
rather than software that solves a class of problems generally. I believe:

- in [stripped and liberated](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8013616) software;
- in [the Unix philosophy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy), especially its rule of composition;
- that "[programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/sicp/book/node3.html)";
- that [premature abstraction](https://twitter.com/JefClaes/status/479938803038420992/photo/1) ([viz.](http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3606739?uid=3737864&uid=2&uid=4&sid=21104341026637)) is just as bad as, or worse than, premature optimization;
- that my mind is always open to persuasive arguments otherwise!
