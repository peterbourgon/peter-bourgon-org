Social media icons are ubiquitous on the modern internet, haphazardly-placed
and misaligned, almost background noise. But they’re not passive: each one is
a beacon, tracking your online movement and associating it to your social
media account. Every thumbs-up, every +1, every plaintive call to Share
now/please share thereby co-opts our natural sense of social identity, and
subverts the relationship between content and viewer.

The exhibit collected just a fraction of the icons that might be encountered
in a few days’ internet use, stripping them of their context to highlight
their absurdity.
