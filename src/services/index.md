I offer a few consulting services, as time allows.
I'm also available for longer-term technical advisor roles.
If any of these topics are interesting to your organization, please get in touch:

## Go language training

I've been programming Go since its release in 2009, and I've been doing it full-time and professionally since 2011.
I've written
 [line of business applications](https://developers.soundcloud.com/blog/architecture-behind-our-new-search-and-explore-experience),
 infrastructure glue code,
 [distributed data systems](https://github.com/soundcloud/roshi),
 deployment and orchestration platforms, 
 [end-to-end logging systems](/ok-log), and
 [toolkits for microservices](https://github.com/go-kit/kit).
If your organization wants to level up your Go knowledge, I can probably help. 

I can given half- or full-day courses on pretty much any Go-related topic you
can imagine, always with an emphasis on practical and high-quality software
engineering. I also do a 3- to 4-day intensive course, teaching Go from first
principles to groups of any skill level. My training style is thorough,
didactic, and interactive. I highlight best practices, idioms, and antipatterns:
stuff you can't easily get from books and literature.

## Microservices and architecture consulting

I wrote [Go kit](https://gokit.io) to address many of the problems that I've
seen confound organizations as they attempt to balkanize their monoliths and
improve their product velocity. If your organization is thinking about adopting
microservices, or just needs some pointers from someone who's seen all the ways
it can go wrong, I can probably help.

I'm not a microservices zealot: a more elegant monolith is often the better
answer. I take the time to understand the history and inertia of your
organization, and deliver specific, actionable advice. I've helped VPs and
directors shape their engineering strategy, and teams of engineers improve their
implementations.

## Observability consulting

I grew up with [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) at SoundCloud, I've worked in
the observability-related developer tooling market, and I've built out an
observability infrastructure at a global-scale organization. I have a good and
intuitive understanding of what makes an observable distributed system, and I
can help your organization level-up your logging, monitoring, and tracing. I've
also developed strategies to justify observability spend to upper management.
